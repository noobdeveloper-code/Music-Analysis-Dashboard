📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Spotify Tracks dataset and builds an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze track characteristics, artist performance, and overall music trends. The dataset includes information about track popularity, genres, artists, duration, explicit labels, and musical attributes such as danceability, energy, and tempo.

The goal is to demonstrate how data visualization can transform raw music data into actionable insights.

Popularity Distribution: Histogram showing how popularity is spread across tracks.

Top N Artists (dynamic): Bar chart with parameter control to view top artists by average popularity.

Danceability vs Energy (Scatter Plot): Exploration of track features, with point size representing popularity.
